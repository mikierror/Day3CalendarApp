# 🗓️ Weekly Calendar App - Day 3 of 15 Days Machine Coding Challenge

This is **Day 3** of my **15-day Machine Coding Challenge**, where I’m building real-world frontend projects daily to sharpen my development skills and prepare for job-ready coding interviews.

## 🚀 Project: Weekly Calendar App (Google Calendar Clone)

A simple and interactive calendar application where users can:

- View a 7x24 weekly grid
- Click on any time slot to add an event
- Input **Title**, **Start Time**, and **End Time**
- See events visually placed based on time
- Delete events directly from the calendar
- Events persist via **Local Storage**


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **LocalStorage** (for data persistence)
